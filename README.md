# nyt-wordle-solver

# Description
nyt-wordle-solver is a small Python script that I made to help me solve the Wordle. It contains the logic needed to filter out words as you guess and suggests the next best word for you to use.

# Installing and Running
All you need is a Python interpreter to run the script. Run `main.py` and use the command line interface to help you get through the Wordle!

# What I learned
* Using argparse to design flexible command line interface scripts
* Designing reusable, object-oriented Python classes
* Translating game rules to code
* Designing an algorithm that chooses the best word to guess next 

# Credits
The scoring dictionary for letters comes from this [research](https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/letterfrequencies.html) on letter frequencies. I also want to mention that I have nothing to do with the New York Times nor the Wordle game and made this project as a fun way to help me and my friends solve the daily puzzle.
